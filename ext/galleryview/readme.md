## Frequently Asked Questions
This section will be updated soon.

---


# Getting Started
1. Place galleryview-x.x folder somewhere in your website directory structure (you can rename this folder if desired)

2. Include script tags for the desired version of the script (uncompressed, packed) and for the included jQuery Timers and Easing plugin files

3. Include a reference to the jquery.galleryview-x.x.css stylesheet in your document

4. Create an unordered list in your HTML with the content you wish to be displayed in your gallery (see below for more information on markup options

5. Add class "galleryView" to the unordered list to make it invisible at firt (in order to prevent a flash of unstyled content).

6. Call the GalleryView plugin with the function call below:

	```js
	jQuery('#id_of_list').galleryView()
	```

	To override default option values, include them in object literal format in the call to the plugin, like so:

	```js
	jQuery('#id_of_list').galleryView({
		panel_width: 800,
		panel_height: 600,
		frame_width: 120,
		frame_height: 90
	});
	```
	
	Refer to the uncompressed javascript to see a full list of options, their effects on the plugin and their default values.
	


### HTML MARKUP REQUIREMENTS
Below, I will show you the markup required to produce various types of galleries. After the first example, 
I will exclude the UL wrapper and only show the HTML necessary for a single panel and/or frame.

1. Basic slideshow (no added features)

	```html
	<ul id="gallery" class="galleryView">
		<li><img src="../gv/path/to/image1.jpg" alt="image1" /></li>
		<li><img src="../gv/path/to/image2.jpg" alt="image2" /></li>
		<li><img src="../gv/path/to/image3.jpg" alt="image3" /></li>
		<li><img src="../gv/path/to/image4.jpg" alt="image4" /></li>
	</ul>
	```

	This is the simplest gallery one can have. By default, the filmstrip will appear below the panels. The number of frames visible will be determined by the size of the panels. If there is enough space in the gallery to fit all the filmstrip frames, the filmstrip will be centered within the gallery. If there are too many frames, the additional frames will be hidden from view initially, appearing as the filmstrip slides to the left with each transition. Panel and frame dimensions are set via plugin options, as is the location of the filmstrip. It can be set to appear below, above, or to either side of the panels.

2. Slideshow with custom thumbnails
	```html
	<li>
		<img src="../gv/path/to/image.jpg" data-frame="../gv/path/to/thumb.jpg" alt="image" height="" width="" />
	</li>
	```

	By adding a data-frame attribute with a relative or absolute path to a separate image, GalleryView will use it to populate the thumbnail. This can be helpful when using large panel images and small thumbnails to avoid degradation due to scaling.
	
3. Slideshow with panel overlays
	```html
	<li>
		<img src="../gv/path/to/image.jpg" alt="image" title="Pretty Picture" data-description="Some more information about the photo" height="" width="" />
	</li>
	```

	For this gallery, the contents of the title and data-description attributes will display on top of the panel image, its position determined by the 'overlay_position' option. The color of the overlays are  set in the included CSS file.

4. Slideshow with images delayed loading
	```html
	<li><img data-original="../gv/path/to/image1.jpg" src="../css/grey.gif" alt="image1" height="" width="" /></li>
	<li><img data-original="../gv/path/to/image2.jpg" src="../css/grey.gif" alt="image2" height="" width="" /></li>
	<li><img data-original="../gv/path/to/image3.jpg" src="../css/grey.gif" alt="image3" height="" width="" /></li>
	<li><img data-original="../gv/path/to/image4.jpg" src="../css/grey.gif" alt="image4" height="" width="" /></li>
	```
	
	Put placeholder image into src attribute and store real image url in data-original attribute. The browser won't load the real images until the GalleryView is initialized (that is, when <code>$('#id_of_list').galleryView()</code> is called). This feature is inspired by the [Lazy Load Plugin for jQuery](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload) by [Mika Tuupola](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload).
	
### CREATING/USING CUSTOM NAVIGATION THEMES
GalleryView comes with two themes by default:
* dark
* light

The dark themes contain dark navigation buttons and are best used in galleries with light backgrounds. The light themes contain light colored images and are best for galleries with dark backgrounds. Both themes also contain oversized panel navigation buttons to demonstrate GalleryView's ability to use any kind of navigation images you may want to use.

To create your own navigation theme, first create the following images:
* next.png
* prev.png
* play.png
* pause.png
* panel-nav-next.png
* panel-nav-prev.png

The images can be of any file type. Then, update the galleryView CSS file with the paths to your new navigation images.
